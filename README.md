Started learning about Computers.

I have been watching Crash Course Computer Science crash course, and it is really interesting.

The more I watch the Crash Course Computer Science series the more I get hooked and want to quickly jump into learning how to code.

Still keeping it going!

Today, I have completed the Crash Course Computer Science Series, and I'm excited to start Harvard's CS50 Introduction to Computer Science course Tomorrow.

I have started HarvardX's CS50's Introduction to Computer Science course. And I did it, I printed Hello, World!
